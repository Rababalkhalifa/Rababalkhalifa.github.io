excerpt: "This paper presents our submission to the SardiStance 2020 shared task, describing the architecture used for Task A and Task B. While our submission for Task A did not exceed the baseline, retraining our model using all the training tweets, showed promising results leading to (f-avg 0.601) using bidirectional LSTM with BERT multilingual embedding for Task A. For our submission for Task B, we ranked 6th (f-avg 0.709). With further investigation, our best experimented settings increased performance from (f-avg 0.573) to (f-avg 0.733) with same architecture and parameter settings and after only incorporating social interaction features -- highlighting the impact of social interaction on the model's performance."
