excerpt: 'In this paper, we present the results and main findings of our system for the DIACR-Ita 2020 Task. Our system focuses on using variations of training sets and different semantic detection methods. The task involves training, aligning and predicting a word’s vector change from two diachronic Italian corpora. We demonstrate that using Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass C-BOW model is more effective compared to different approaches including Logistic Regression and a Feed Forward Neural Network using accuracy. Our model ranked 3rd with an accuracy of 83.3%.'
